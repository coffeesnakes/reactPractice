a component is either a function or a class.

BABEL => Compiler
BABEL is a dependency that takes JSX and converts it down to ES5 so it's able to be understood.

    Component nesting
  You create components and then nest them inside of eachother.

  Component Reusability
Things like buttons need to only be coded once, and you strive to make little pieces of code that can be reused
several different times throughout your Application

  Component Configuration
Being able to customize reusable things, for instance a button should have the
ability to configure the text on each individual button with ease, that's configuration.











when you return jsx the opening line  has to be to the right of the return statement or else use parenthesis <= normal convention


double quotes to indicate string
single quotes for any non-string JSX convention.

className is the same as class in html. It's used to avoid collision with class declaration (class App extends React.component)

JSX CAN VERY EASILY REFERENCE JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES
