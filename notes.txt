a component is either a function or a class.

BABEL => Compiler
BABEL is a dependency that takes JSX and converts it down to ES5 so it's able to be understood.

when you return jsx the opening line  has to be to the right of the return statement or else use parenthesis <= normal convention


double quotes to indicate string
single quotes for any non-string JSX convention.

className is the same as class in html. It's used to avoid collision with class declaration (class App extends React.component)

JSX CAN VERY EASILY REFERENCE JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES
